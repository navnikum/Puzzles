Question: You have 3 baskets, one with apples, one with oranges and one with both apples and oranges mixed. 
          Each basket is closed and is labeled with ‘Apples’, ‘Oranges’ and ‘Apples and Oranges’. 
          However, each of these labels is always placed incorrectly. 
          How would you pick only one fruit from a basket to place the labels correctly on all the baskets?
          
Answer: Say you pick a fruit from the basket labeled ‘Apples and Oranges’.
        If this fruit is an apple, then we know that since the label is incorrect, this basket only contains apples. 
        Now that we’ve determined that the basket marked as ‘Apples and Oranges’ only contains apples, we can figure out 
        what the other baskets contain. If we look at the basket labeled as ‘Oranges’, we know that since the label is incorrect, 
        this basket either has only apples in it or has both apples and oranges. Since we’ve already established that the basket 
        labeled ‘Apples and Oranges’ contains only apples, we know that the basket labeled as ‘Oranges’ contains both apples and oranges. 
        Then by simple process of elimination, we know that the basket labeled as ‘Apples’ contains only oranges.
