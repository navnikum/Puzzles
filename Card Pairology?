Question: John and Matt decide to play a game using a deck of cards. The game involves flipping two cards at a time. 
          If both cards are black, they go into John’s pile and if both cards are red, they go into Matt’s pile. 
          If one card is red and one card is black, they go into a discard pile. The game is played until all 52 cards have been flipped. 
          The person with the most cards in their pile wins. If there is a tie, John wins. If Matt has more cards than John, 
          then John pays Matt a dollar. 
          What is the chance of Matt getting a dollar?
          
 Answer: Here’s a table to explain each case.

                John	  Discarded	Matt
                13 pairs  0 pairs	13 pairs
                12 pairs  2 pairs	12 pairs
                11 pairs  4 pairs	11 pairs
                10 pairs  6 pairs	10 pairs
                9 pairs   8 pairs	9 pairs
                8 pairs	  10 pairs	8 pairs
                7 pairs	  12 pairs	7 pairs
                6 pairs	  14 pairs	6 pairs
                5 pairs	  16 pairs	5 pairs
                4 pairs	  18 pairs	4 pairs
                3 pairs	  20 pairs	3 pairs
                2 pairs	  22 pairs	2 pairs
                1 pair	  24 pairs	1 pair
                0 pairs	  26 pairs	0 pairs
                
                
           Say the deck is arranged in a way such that there are 13 black pairs. In this situation, John gets 13 black pairs.
           And since there are no other black cards left, Matt gets 13 red pairs too. So there’s a tie and John wins.

          Suppose there are 12 black pairs in the deck. In this case, there would be 2 black cards left in the deck that would pair up 
          with 2 other red cards in the deck. These 2 black cards would never be together since we have already claimed that there are
          only 12 black pairs in the deck. As a result, 2 pairs of cards end up in the discard pile. 
          The remaining cards would all be red and Matt would get 12 red pairs too. So once again, there’s a tie and John wins.
          
          
          So we see that in any case, there is a tie between John and Matt. So Matt never ends up with a dollar.
