Question: A duck that is being chased by a fox saves itself by sitting at the center of circular pond of radius r. 
          The duck can fly from land but cannot fly from the water. Furthermore, the fox cannot swim. 
          The fox is four times faster than the duck. Assuming that the duck and fox are perfectly smart, is it possible
          for the duck to ever reach the edge of the pond and fly away to its escape from the ground?
          
Answer: The duck could swim in concentric circles, so that the fox has to continuously run along the circumference of the pond 
        to stay on the same radius as the duck. If the duck swims near the edge of the pond, the fox could easily keep up 
        since they would be covering approximately the same distance and the fox is four times faster. 
        But what if the duck swam closer to the center of the pond? The duck would have to cover a smaller circumference, 
        and could use this strategy to put some distance between the fox and itself. 
        At a distance of r/4 from the center of the pond, the circumference of the pond is exactly four times the 
        circumference of the duck’s path. Thus, to stay on the same radius as the duck, the fox would barely keep up.

        Say, the duck circles the pond at a distance r/4 – e, where e is an infinitesimal amount. 
        So as the duck continues to swim along this radius, it would slowly gain some distance over the fox. 
        Once the duck is able to gain 180 degrees over the fox, the duck would have to cover a distance of 
        3r/4 + e to reach the edge of the pond. In the meanwhile, the fox would have to cover half the circumference of
        the pond (i.e the 180 degrees). At that point,

                  (pi * r ) > 4 * (3r/4 + e)

        The duck would be able to make it to land and fly away.
