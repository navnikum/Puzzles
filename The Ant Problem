Question: Three ants are sitting at the three corners of an equilateral triangle. Each ant starts randomly picks a direction and
          starts to move along the edge of the triangle. What is the probability that none of the ants collide?
          
Answer: P(No collision) = P(All ants go in a clockwise direction) + P( All ants go in an anti-clockwise direction) 
                        = 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 + 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25
