Question: There are four dogs each at the corner of a unit square. Each of the dogs starts chasing the dog in the clockwise direction.
          They all run at the same speed and continuously change their direction accordingly so that they are always heading straight 
          towards the other dog. How long does it take for the dogs to catch each other and where?
          
Answer: By symmetry all the dogs will eventually meet in the center of the square. 
        The speed of each of the dog towards the dog it is chasing is given by (1 + cos(t)) where t is the angle on each corner
        of the square.

                                  Speed of dog = 1 + cos(90) = 1 + 0 = 1
                                  Time needed = Distance/Speed = 1 / 1 = 1 unit.
