Question: Four people need to cross a rickety bridge at night. Unfortunately, they have only one torch and the bridge is too dangerous 
          to cross without one. The bridge is only strong enough to support two people at a time. Not all people take
          the same time to cross the bridge. Times for each person:  1 min, 2 mins, 7 mins and 10 mins. 
          What is the shortest time needed for all four of them to cross the bridge?
          
Answer: To reduce the amount of time, we should find a way for 10 and 7 to go together. If they cross together, 
        then we need one of them to come back to get the others. That would not be ideal. 
        How do we get around that? Maybe we can have 1 waiting on the other side to bring the torch back. Ahaa, we are getting closer. 
                      1 and 2 go across
                      2 comes back
                      7 and 10 go across
                      1 comes back
                      1 and 2 go across (done)

        Total time = 2 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 2 = 17 mins
