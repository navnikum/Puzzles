Question: You are standing outside a room next to three switches, all of which are off.
          Each switch operates a different light bulb in the room. The room door is closed, so you cannot see which switch 
          operates which bulb. You are only allowed to go into the room once. Determine which switch operates which bulb.
          
Answer: First, we turn the first switch on and leave the other two off. 
        After 5 minutes, we turn the first switch off, turn the second switch on and leave the third switch off. 
        Then we go into the room and touch one of the bulbs which is turned off. 
        After that, it would be easy to tell that the first switch matches the warm bulb, the second switch matches the bulb 
        thats turned on and the third switch matches the colder bulb.
