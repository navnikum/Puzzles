Question: You are given two hourglasses. One measures 4 minutes and one measures 7 minutes. How would you measure exactly 9 minutes?


Answer: This question is similar to 4 Quarts of Water. With water, we were able to fill and pour out the pail multiple times. 
        We can use the same logic and easily come up solutions which start measuring 9 minutes somewhere in the middle of the 
        procedure but those will not be ideal. If possible, we want to measure the 9 minutes right from the start.


        Step	     Time	    4 minute timer	             7 minute timer
        
        1	     0 min	    Start	                     Start
        2    	     4 mins	    Flip	                     3 minutes left
        3	     7 mins	    1 minute left	             Flip
        4	     8 mins	    Stop	                     Flip (1 minute left)
        5	     9 mins	    Stop
