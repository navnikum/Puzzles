Question: How many points are there on the globe where, by walking one mile south, then one mile east and then one mile north, 
          you would reach the place where you started?
          
          
Answer: The trivial answer to this question is one point, namely, the North Pole.

        If we consider the southern hemisphere, there is a ring near the South Pole that has a circumference of one mile. 
        So what’s our running total of possible points? We have 1 + infinite points. But we’re not done yet!
        
        Similarly, for any positive integer n, there is a circle with radius

                      r = 1 / (2 * pi * n)

        centered at the South Pole. Walking one mile along these rings would cause us to circle n times and return to the same point 
        as we started. There are infinite possible values for n. 
        
        So the real answer to this question is 1 + infinity * infinity = infinite possible points!
