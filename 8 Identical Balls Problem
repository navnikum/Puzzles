Question: You are given 8 identical looking balls. One of them is heavier than the rest of the 7 (all the others weigh exactly the same). 
          You a provided with a simple mechanical balance and you are restricted to only 2 uses. Find the heavier ball.

Answer: For convenience sake, letâ€™s name the balls 1-8. First we weigh {1,2,3} on the left and {4,5,6} on the right. 
        There are three scenarios which can arise from this.

        If the left side is heavier, then we know that one of 1, 2 or 3 is the heavier ball. 
        Weigh {1} on the left and {2} on the right. By doing this, we will know if 1 or 2 is heavier. 
        If they balance out, then 3 is the heavier one.

        If the right side is heavier, then we know that either 4, 5 or 6 is the heavier ball. 
        Weigh {4} on the left and {5} on the right. By doing this we will know if 4 or 5 is heavier. 
        If they balance out, then 6 is the heavier one.

        If {1,2,3} and {4,5,6} balance out, then we know either 7 or 8 is the heavier one. 
        Weigh both of them to find out which one is heavier.
