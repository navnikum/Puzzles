Question: A farmer bought a goat, a wolf and a cabbage from the market. On his way home, he has to cross a river. 
          He has a small boat which only allows him to take one thing with him at a time. 
          The farmer cannot leave the cabbage and the goat together (the goat would eat the cabbage) 
          nor can he leave the goat and the wolf together (the wolf would eat the goat).
          How does he cross the river without losing any of the things he bought?
          
 Answer: The farmer first takes the goat with him and leaves it on the other side. Then he comes back and gets the wolf. 
         He leaves the wolf on the other side, and brings back the goat. Then he leaves the goat and brings the cabbage with him. 
         He then leaves the cabbage with the wolf and comes back to get the goat.
